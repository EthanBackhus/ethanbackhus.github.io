      Learning the Full Stack: HTTP/3, QUIC, and Rust Networking

    <p>
      In an attempt to become a more well-rounded developer, I've been working to understand all parts of the stack.
      This has lead me to researching and messing around with networking and infra, and the core protocols that run underneath it.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get hands-on experience, I created a Rust networking lab where I implemented a small HTTP/3 server using the quinn library 
      (a Rust QUIC implementation) and experimented with client-server interactions over QUIC. 
      This has allowed me to explore real issues like congestion control, stream multiplexing, and packet loss recovery in a 
      controlled environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The architecture I'm exploring follows the HTTP/3 -> h3 -> quinn pipeline.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quinn handles the low-level QUIC transport over UDP, including encryption, reliable delivery, and stream multiplexing.
    </p>

    <p>
      H3 provides the HTTP/3 framing layer, translating requests and responses into QUIC streams.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTTP/3 sits on top, giving me the familiar semantics of headers, status codes, and request/response logic.
    </p>

    <P>
      Next, I aim to integrate HTTP/3 support into Hyper, Rust’s popular HTTP library. 
      The goal is to allow Hyper clients and servers to natively speak HTTP/3 while maintaining the same ergonomic
       API as Hyper over TCP/HTTP/1/2. This is exciting because it bridges real-world application-level HTTP
        tooling with the cutting-edge transport improvements QUIC offers.
    </P>

    <p>
      I’m documenting this journey and sharing code experiments to help others understand how modern 
      networking stacks work, and to solidify my own knowledge by building and teaching it in public.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
      Thus I've begun exploring the different networking protocols that allow data to be sent over the internet. Currently, the two main
      networking protocols are TCP and UDP. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, TCP allows for more secure connection but is slower
      because there is more validation that takes place (synchornize, synchronize-acknowlege, and acknowledge, or SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK). UDP allows
      for much faster data streams because it's just simply raw data, but isn't as secure and doesn't handle data loss at all. TCP can be
      useful for most modern web functions, and UDP can be useful where latency and throughput is most important, like playing a video game.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is where QUIC comes in, which aims to fix both of these problems. HTTP/3 is the

    <!-- <p>
      You can think of TCP like two people engaging in a hanshake. One person extends their hand and asks the other if they're ready to talk,
      the other person shakes their hand and acknowledges they're ready to talk, and the first person shakes their hand back saying they'd like to continue
      talking.
    </p> -->


    <!-- <h2>Why User-Space Transport Changes Everything</h2>

    <p>
      Traditional TCP hides control decisions inside the kernel.
      QUIC exposes them, which changes how systems evolve.
